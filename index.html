            <p>Hola! Iâ€™m Vito Rihaldijiran, a Postgraduate Student at <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">The Australian National University (ANU)</a>, majoring in Applied Data Analytics.
            I am currently collaborating with the <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/">ANU Biological Data Science Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO</a>,
            working on crop-yield prediction using Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to estimate key parameters. Under the guidance of <a href="https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/ayman-gh">Dr. Ayman Elgharabawy</a> and <a href="https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/brian-parker">Dr. Brian Parker</a>, I am integrating data science with complex biological systems to address real-world agricultural challenges.</p>
            
            <p>Iâ€™m deeply interested in how computational biology can help us explore the complexities of biological systems using advanced computational methods like machine learning and stochastic modeling. My work focuses on predicting and interpreting biological processes, with applications in fields such as agriculture, healthcare, and environmental science. </p>
