            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>Hope Schroeder here. I'm a PhD student at the <a href="#">MIT Center for Constructive Communication</a>. I'm interested in how NLP methods can help us investigate social phenomena and facilitate communication on major challenges in the world today.</p>
            <p>Get in touch if you want to talk about generative AI, facilitated dialogue, or unique methods of understanding the media ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Some recent updates (7/2024):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paper:</strong> "A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" was accepted to ACL Main and will be presented there in August 2024 as well as IC2S2 2024. Learn more about the corpus <a href="#">here</a>. A pre-print is linked <a href="#">here</a>!</li>
                <li>This summer, I am interning at Microsoft Research Labs in New York City for the second time. This year, I am working with Solon Barocas on the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI (FATE) group on evaluating risks and opportunities of LLMs in social research.</li>
                <li>Our CHI 2024 workshop LLMs for Data Work was a success, and public papers are posted <a href="#">here</a>!</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In Summer 2023, I worked at Microsoft Research Labs' Computational Social Science team under David Rothschild, investigating the use of LLMs for news polling and understanding. Paper forthcoming!</li>
                <li>In June 2023, <a href="#">Art and the Science of Generative AI</a> came out as a Science Perspectives piece.</li>
                <li>In Spring 2023, I co-instructed a course on <a href="#">Generative AI for Constructive Communication at MIT</a>.</li>

        <!-- About Me -->
        <section class="about">
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I graduated with an MSc in <a href="#">Social Data Science</a> (Distinction) at the <a href="#">Oxford Internet Institute</a> as a Clarendon Scholar at <a href="#">Christ Church</a>. I was a 2019 graduate of Stanford in <a href="#">Symbolic Systems</a> with honors.</p>
            <p>Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our <a href="#">Magic Grant project</a> on a contested plaque site at Stanford received <a href="#">global press</a>. <a href="#">A case study</a> on this work received the Best Case Study Award at <a href="#">CHI 2023</a>!</p>
